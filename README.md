## About Raccoon Chat

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/448fbdff-0d30-425a-87b2-74aefd019d82)


Raccoon Chat was developed as part of a take-home challenge. The task was to create an interactive chat interface that supports real-time messaging and showcases creative in-chat previews for various types of products or components. The primary objective was to demonstrate my ability to tackle unfamiliar problems, quickly find effective solutions (the 80-20 rule), and outline my process for achieving a comprehensive, fully-functional result.

### Problem Statement: Interactive Real-Time Chat Interface Design

#### Background

Providing an efficient and user-friendly chat interface is crucial for enhancing user support and interaction. A well-designed chat interface can significantly improve communication and collaboration among users.

#### Objective
Develop an interactive chat interface that supports real-time messaging and showcases creative in-chat previews for various types of products or any component. The system should:
1. Support real-time messaging between users.
2. Allow users to preview different types of content directly within the chat.
3. Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience..
